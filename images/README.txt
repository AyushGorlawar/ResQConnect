LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Please save the ResQConnect logo image as:
- images/logo.png (main logo)
- images/logo-icon.png (favicon version, 32x32 or 64x64 pixels)

The HTML files have been updated to reference these images.
You can simply save your logo image with these filenames and it will work automatically.
